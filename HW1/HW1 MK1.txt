CREATE TABLE Professor(
	ssn int PRIMARY KEY,
	p_name char(24),
	since date,
	tenure Boolean	
	)
	
We require a tenured professor to have a 1 in the tenure column and a junior professor 0 while since refers to the year a professor earned tenure for a tenured professor or the number of years a professor has been hired for a junior professor.

CREATE TABLE Department(
	d_name char(24) PRIMARY KEY
	)
	
CREATE TABLE is_affiliated_with(
	ssn int,	
	d_name char(24) REFERENCES Department NOT NULL,
	PRIMARY KEY (ssn),
	FOREIGN KEY (ssn) REFERENCES Professor
	)

We want to ensure that a professor would be at least affiliated with one department. Since we were taught SQL does not have a method for us to do that (at least up till what we have learned), the constraint is assumed to be baked into the application.

CREATE TABLE has_chair(
	ssn int, NOT NULL,
	tenure int, NOT NULL,
	CHECK (tenure = 1),
	d_name char(24) REFERENCES Department,
	PRIMARY KEY (d_name),
	FOREIGN KEY (ssn, tenure) REFERENCES Professor (ssn, tenure)
	)

We do not need SSN to be part of the primary key as each department can only have one chair. However, we need to both ssn and tenure to be a foreign key as we need to verify that any professor participating in the above relationship is tenured.

CREATE TABLE Course_Department(
	c_no int,
	c_name char(24),
	c_capac int,
	d_name char(24),
	PRIMARY KEY (c_no, d_name)
	FOREIGN KEY (d_name) REFERENCES Department
		ON DELETE CASCADE
	)

According to the requirements, course department is a weak entity dependent on 
 as it is stated that the course number only uniquely identifies courses within a department.

CREATE TABLE CD_Term_Taught(
	c_no int 
	d_name char(24) 
	ssn int REFERENCES Professor,
	t_semester char(24),
	t_year date,
	PRIMARY KEY ((c_no, d_name), t_semester, t_year),
	FOREIGN KEY (c,no, d,name) REFERENCES Course_Department
	)

We assume that the we can uniquely identify a course by its name, the department sponsoring it and the semester year it was taught. The entities c_no and d_name are set as a tuple within the primary key to keep the constraint that each course is only sponsored by a single department. There is no constraint for set for professor.
