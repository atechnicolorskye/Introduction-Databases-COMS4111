When a user follows another user
|User| = \Follows\ (= means refers back to same entity)

CREATE TABLE Users{
	uid,
	...	
}

CREATE TABLE Follows{
	uid_src,
	uid_dest
	PRIMARY KEY(uid_src, uid_dest)
	FOREIGN KEY(uid_src) REFERENCES User(uid)
	FOREIGN KEY(uid_dest) REFERENCES User(uid)
}

User is a student and instructor
|User| - \IS_A\ - |Student|
				- |Instructor|

CREATE TABLE User (uid)
CREATE TABLE Student{
	uid,
	....,
	PRIMARY KEY(uid)
	FOREIGN KEY(uid) REFERENCES User
	}		 
Same for Instructor

User only: Exist in user record only
Student only: Exist in user, student record only
Same for Instructor and Student and Instructor
Cannot have a case where there is record only in Student and Instructor as due to FOREIGN KEY requiring uid

When we want only students or instructors, have no user table but only a table for students and instructors

CREATE TABLE Student{
	User attributes ....
	Student attributes ...
	PRIMARY KEY(uid)
	}
Same for instructor
Can have the case where same person has a record in student and instructor as no FOREIGN KEY constraint

Multiple Columns
FOREIGN KEYS can either reference nothing or a record e.g.

CREATE TABLE A{
	a,
	b,
	c,
	PRIMARY KEY(a,b,c)
	}
	
CREATE TABLE B{
	a,
	b,
	c,
	FOREIGN KEY(a,b,c) REFERENCES A
	}

So in B, we can have (NULL, NULL, NULL) but not (5, NULL, 13). SQL does not need PRIMARY KEY

CREATE TABLE C{
	a,
	b,
	c,
	FOREIGN KEY(a,b) REFERENCES X
	FOREIGN KEY(c) REFERENCES Y
	}
	
So in C, we have (5, 4, NULL) but not (NULL, 4, NULL)

|Book| -> \Loan\ - |User|

CREATE TABLE Book{
	bid int,
	uid_borrower int,
	PRIMARY KEY(bid)
	FOREIGN KEY(uid) REFERENCES User
	}
	
When borrowing book, add uid to uid_borrower. After returning, set uid_borrower to NULL

|Recipes| - \Contains\ <= |Ingredients| (<= means weak entity)
We want Ingredient to be weak entities as there might be any number of them in a recipe, therefore can be thought as have variable number of childrens
